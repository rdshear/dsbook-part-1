# R {.unnumbered}

In this book, we will be using the R software environment for all our analysis. You will learn R and data analysis techniques simultaneously. To follow along you will therefore need access to R. We also recommend the use of an *integrated development environment* (IDE), such as RStudio, to save your work. Note that it is common for a course or workshop to offer access to an R environment and an IDE through your web browser, as done by RStudio cloud[^intro-to-r-1]. If you have access to such a resource, you don't need to install R and RStudio. However, if you intend on becoming an advanced data analyst, we highly recommend installing these tools on your computer[^intro-to-r-2]. Both R and RStudio are free and available online.
